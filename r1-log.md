The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 28, Sunday, 2018.

## Log

### Day 1
Added user authentication to application using Passport.

### Day 2
Changed data models after reconsidering information I need to capture from the user. Made some UI changes and ensured that only logged in users can save information.

### Day 3
Completed Edit and Delete routes. Ensured only logged in authorised users can now edit/delete comments. Ran into difficulty with author.id not being saved to the database. Turned out to be due to a typo. Grrr. In trying to fix it tried displaying Username in Comments — not sure I like it, will remove.
