# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Bravetank

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 28, Sunday, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
Added user authentication to tracker application using Passport.  

### R1D2
Changed data models after reconsidering information I need to capture from the user. Made some UI changes and ensured that only logged in users can record information. 

### R1D3
Completed Treatment and Comment Edit and Delete routes including ensuring only logged in authorised users can edit/delete certain comments. Ran into difficulty with author.id not being saved to the database. Turned out to be due to a typo. Grrr. In trying to fix it tried displaying Username in Comments -  not sure I like it as I'm using this as side effect update so will always be same user. Will need to remove. Completed Trello Board for Mission 2 of CodeMore. Have basically planned tracker work for next month. Also wrote short post on APIs on Medium.   

### R1D4
Finished refactoring middleware, added Connect-Flash error messages and a sliding background on landing page.

### R1D5
Deloyed app to Heroku and started using MLabs. Tested. It works. Very happy.
