# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Bravetank

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 28, Sunday, 2018.

## Log

### Day 1
Added user authentication to application using Passport.

### Day 2
Changed data models after reconsidering information I need to capture from the user. Made some UI changes and ensured that only logged in users can save information.

### Day 3
Completed Edit and Delete routes. Ensured only logged in authorised users can now edit/delete comments. Ran into difficulty with author.id not being saved to the database. Turned out to be due to a typo. Grrr. In trying to fix it tried displaying Username in Comments — not sure I like it, will remove.

### Day 4
Finished refactoring middleware, added Connect-Flash error messages and a sliding background on landing page.

### Day 5
Deployed app to Heroku and started using MLabs. Tested. It works. Very happy.

### Day 6 
Did some exercises on manipulating the DOM, selectors, changing attributes etc.

### Day 7 
More exercises on manipulating the DOM, selectors, changing attributes etc. Completed Scorekeeper demo from the course and uploaded to Github.

### Day 8 
More exercises on the DOM, this time working on the Color Selector game in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course. Good refresher on Math.random & Math.floor.

### Day 9 
Still working on the Color Selector game but also did two FCC Algorithm challenges and started looking into D3 for the data visualisation part of the application. 

### Day 10
Finally finished Color Selector game. Also tweaked some code in the main application I'm working on but needs more work. Updated Trello to detail what will need to be done but not scheduled this yet as now need to move onto JQuery to stay on track. 

### Day 11
Started on JQuery and completed some FCC exercises. 

### Day 12
Started Introduction to Software Product Management course on Coursera.
